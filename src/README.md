	 Put your best hook forward and say Arrrgh or a pirate hello to Louie the Pirate Cat! He can do all 
	 sorts of things like eat some stinky pirate grub, catch some ZzzZs, drink energy drinks, or sail the 
	 7 seas to find some buried treasure. Just input the number on the menu to virtually interact with him. 
	 Keep in mind each time you do something his levels will change. You can quit at any time and Louie's 
	 status will update for you each time you pick something to do. If his levels get too low he will tell 
	 you what he should do to balance it back out. Make sure he stays above 0 throughout the whole game or he 
	 will walk the plank to Davey Jones' locker never to return! That is until next time you want to play.
	 Happy Pirating!
